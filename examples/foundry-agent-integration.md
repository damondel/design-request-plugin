# Azure AI Foundry Agent Integration Examples

This guide shows how to connect Azure AI Foundry agents to the CXS AI Chat Request plugin using different authentication methods.

## Overview

Azure AI Foundry agents can connect to your Figma plugin in three ways:

1. **Anonymous Authentication** (easiest for development)
2. **API Key Authentication** (standard approach)  
3. **Managed Identity** (enterprise-grade security)

## Method 1: Anonymous Authentication (Recommended for Development)

### Step 1: Update Your Server for Anonymous Access

Modify your `server.js` to support anonymous requests:

```javascript
// Add this route for anonymous access
app.post('/api/analyze-anonymous', async (req, res) => {
  // Same logic as /api/analyze but without auth checks
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
  
  try {
    const { elements, type, data } = req.body;
    const elementData = elements || data?.elements || [];
    
    // Your existing analysis logic here...
    const aiResponse = generateMockAIResponse(elementData);
    
    res.json({ success: true, suggestions: aiResponse.suggestions });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});
```

### Step 2: Create OpenAPI Spec for Anonymous Access

Use the provided `examples/openapi-anonymous.json` file which contains the complete OpenAPI specification for anonymous access.

### Step 3: Configure Azure AI Foundry Agent

In Azure AI Foundry:

1. Go to your Agent in the playground
2. Add a new tool â†’ OpenAPI
3. Upload the `openapi-anonymous.json` file
4. No authentication setup needed!

## Method 2: API Key Authentication

### Step 1: Create OpenAPI Spec with API Key

Use the provided `examples/openapi-apikey.json` file which includes API key authentication configuration.

### Step 2: Configure in Azure AI Foundry

1. Upload `openapi-apikey.json`
2. Create a new connection:
   - Type: Custom Keys
   - Key: `x-api-key`
   - Value: `your-plugin-api-key`
   - Connection name: `figma-plugin-connection`

## Method 3: Managed Identity (Production)

### Step 1: Deploy to Azure App Service

```bash
# Deploy your server to Azure App Service
az webapp create --resource-group myResourceGroup --plan myAppServicePlan --name cxs-design-plugin --runtime "NODE|18-lts"
az webapp deployment source config --name cxs-design-plugin --resource-group myResourceGroup --repo-url https://github.com/damondel/design-request-plugin --branch master
```

### Step 2: Enable Managed Identity

```bash
# Enable system-assigned managed identity
az webapp identity assign --name cxs-design-plugin --resource-group myResourceGroup
```

### Step 3: Create OpenAPI Spec for Managed Identity

Create a production OpenAPI spec with managed identity authentication configured for your deployed Azure App Service endpoint.

## Quick Start Instructions

### For the Designer

1. **Start with Anonymous Method** (easiest):
   - Use `examples/openapi-anonymous.json`
   - No authentication setup needed
   - Works immediately with your existing server

2. **If you need security**:
   - Use `examples/openapi-apikey.json`
   - Create a custom keys connection in Azure AI Foundry
   - Add your API key

3. **For production**:
   - Deploy to Azure App Service
   - Use managed identity
   - Upload production OpenAPI spec

## Testing the Integration

Once configured, test the agent by asking:

- "Analyze the selected design elements"
- "Suggest color improvements for this design"  
- "How can I improve the layout of these elements?"

The agent will call your plugin's API and return AI-powered design suggestions!

## Key Benefits

- **Natural Language Interface**: Users can chat with your plugin through the agent
- **AI-Powered Routing**: Agent knows when to use your design analysis tool
- **Existing API Reuse**: No changes needed to your current plugin architecture
- **Scalable Integration**: Works with any OpenAPI-compatible service

## Troubleshooting

**"Connection failed"**: Check CORS headers and endpoint URL

**"No suggestions"**: Verify element data format matches OpenAPI schema

**"Authentication error"**: Use anonymous endpoint for initial testing

The designer was right about needing endpoints and API keys, but this is actually a powerful feature that enables sophisticated integrations!
